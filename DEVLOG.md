### Initial thoughts
One of the main things I'd like to avoid(along with past problems) in this new app is the way I did the components. I used the routes to render the components but I did it by flexing a component to do more than one thing. It should be the same component used in multiple screens and inside the screens is what flexes the component behavior. The screens are based on routes still.

I'll have to look at the old ToDo lists/problems I noted in the repo
