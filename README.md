### About
This is an alternative take on the front end for the Tagging Tracker project. This app is built with ReactJS and utilizes the built in PWA feature. There is a matching [back end](https://github.com/codeforkansascity/tagging-tracker-pwa-backend) for it written in Node.

### Demo

#### Add PWA to your device

### Try this app
The static build of this PWA front end is hosted [here](https://codeforkc.org/tagging-tracker-pwa/), the GitHub pages for this repo.

### Technical Overview
The main features of this app are:
* offline-first functionality using `Dexie` an `IndexedDB` wrapper
* basic auth with JWT
* remote sync of content
* optional storage of photos with AWS S3
* the images are turned into `base64` strings for local storage

### App overview
This is a mockup of this app, these are the current pages/built out capability
![initial mockup](./tagging-tracker-mockup.png)

The pages/routes are generally built out as:
* navbar
* body
* bottom navbar

Where the top and bottom navbar change based on the current route.

#### App structure
The app route structure is based on the mockup above so it looks like this:
* /addresses
    * /view-address
        * /owner-info
        * /tag-info
        * /add-tag
        * /edit-tags
* /login

Initially the first route you would hit or default eg. `/` was login but it didn't make sense with the offline-first workflow.

### General notes
* the Auth token is just held in memory(state variable) so if you refresh you lose the token
    * the mobile app is not able to do pull/refresh since it's disabled by CSS
    * token expiration is 30 minutes
* `Dexie` is being used here which is a wrapper around `IndexedDB`this is a "sql-like" database in the browser so it has related tables/primary indexes/etc... this app isn't really doing anything hardcore, the relationship is:
    * addresses
        * tags
        * ownerInfo
        * tagInfo

The database is started/schema set in `App.js`

### Dev Requirements
This app is based on `create-react-app` so all you need to run it is `node`, `npm` and `npx`.

Note if you're using Ubuntu/linux you may see an issue about file system watchers, check [this link](https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/3254#issuecomment-297214395) out

Note the `.env.example` if you're developing locally then the `REACT_APP_API_BASE_LOCAL` will probably be `localhost:5000` or whatever you choose. The remote API is only needed for login/syncing content.

`REACT_APP_BASE` is more for deployment, the purpose of this variable is for checking that the remote side where the PWA static files will be deployed is not empty/the PWA does not sync with nothing when the PWA cache is cleared.

### Installation
Clone this repo, `cd` into it and then run `npm install`

Once installed, you can run the app with `npm start`

### Deployment
You will need to build the static files with `npm run build` and then deploy these to some static location. You need https for the PWA to work/be installable.

#### Deploy to GitHub Pages
I have set this repo up to use GitHub Pages by the `/docs` folder. So you will build the app by `npm run build` then the static files generated will be in the `/build` folder. Then you can drag those files into the `/docs` folder and they will show up in the `taggingtracker.org` domain. The back end will be hosted in an AWS EC2 instance as a docker container. That should be accessible by `api.taggingtracker.org` once it's configured.

Note: if the url has a subdirectory eg. `domain.com/sub-directory/app-base-path` that will cause problems with routes. There are two places to update:
* `App.js` - modify the `baseName` variable
* `package.json` - update the `homepage` url

**Important** There is a `CNAME` file(no extension), this file is in the `/docs` folder which cotains the files served on GitHub pages for this repo. This file needs to be here for the unique domain. When building/replacing static content, do not delete this file, or remember to add it back. Replace all the other files though, primarily the minified/cached files that need to reflect paths.

#### Note about deployment
If you have a base domain with a sub directory eg. `https://domain.com/subdirectory/` this will be problematic because the routes of the app are only one level deep, so that `/subdirectory/` path will not be recognized as one of the routes that render the pages. This is mentioned above regarding changing `App.js` and `package.json`.

Also note: the gear icon that pulls down new code manually to update the PWA is based on a domain (that I currently run). So a new build pushed up to docs should be copied over to that domain as well. The App checks if that URL exists/has content before overwriting itself.

### Client-side usage/installation
Note that you can't add to homescreen from incognito. Also for iOS only Safari can add to home screen.

### Work in progress
Here is a [TODO list](https://github.com/codeforkansascity/tagging-tracker-pwa/blob/master/TODO.md) mostly regarding cross browser styling and functionality issues as well as code cleanup/refactoring.

### More info
The original PWA/Node app was developed on this monolithic repo [here](https://github.com/jdc-cunningham/codeforkc--tagging-tracker/)
