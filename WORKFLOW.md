### About
This primarily serves as a quick check on functionality since there are no tests/pipelines these commits/builds go through. I uploaded a broken login page for example as I didn't test it.

- from main/address page click login
  - see TT logo, user/pass/login
- login
  - takes you back to addresses
  - try to sync
    - no data or update with addresses
  - logout
    - see one Login button on bottom navbar
- while logged in
  - view an address
    - view an event
      - modify
      - see tags
- add new address
  - click on new address
    - add event, save
    - edit owner info, save
- sync up
  - doesn't fail
  - log out, login, sync to pull down same data uploaded
